/**
 * {@code TabletManager} is responsible for detecting interesting
 * events, translating them into {@link cello.jtablet.event.TabletEvent}
 * objects, and finally broadcasting them to all registered
 * {@link cello.jtablet.event.TabletListener}s.
 * 
 * {@code TabletManager} relies on concrete private subclasses to
 * grab events from particular native libraries (e.g. Wacom's WinTab
 * driver, Cocoa's NSEvent system, or X11's XInput). Given the
 * difficulty in determining if a particular native library is
 * supported on the end-user's system, we provide the simple static
 * {@link TabletManager}.{@link TabletManager#getDefaultManager()}
 * method that is guarnteed to return a {@code TabletManager} which
 * is compatible.
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *  // Get tablet manager
 *  {@link TabletManager} manager = {@link TabletManager}.{@link TabletManager#getDefaultManager()};
 *  
 *  // Add tablet listener to component
 *  manager.{@link TabletManager#addTabletListener(Component, TabletListener) addTabletListener}(component, new {@link TabletAdapter}() {
 *      public void {@link TabletListener#cursorDragged(TabletEvent) cursorDragged}({@link TabletEvent} event) {
 *          // Print out tablet drag events as they occur to system output
 *          System.out.println("dragged " + event);
 *      }
 *  });
