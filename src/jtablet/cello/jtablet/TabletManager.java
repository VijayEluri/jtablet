/**
 * <p>{@link TabletManager} is the central hub of the JTablet architecture.
 * {@link TabletDriver}s send the events they observe here where they are
 * massaged, filtered, and finally forwarded to appropriate {@link TabletListener}s.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link TabletManager} is also responsible for automatically creating
 * and starting the {@link TabletDriver}s. It is this behavior that makes
 * JTablet so easy to use. Only two things are required to begin receiving
 * {@link TabletEvent}s: declaring your class a {@link TabletListener}, and
 * calling {@link TabletManager}.{@link TabletManager#addTabletListener(Component, TabletListener) addTabletListener}
 * to add it as a listener.
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *  // Add tablet listener to component
 *  {@link TabletManager}.{@link TabletManager#addTabletListener(Component, TabletListener) addTabletListener}(component, new {@link TabletAdapter}() {
 *      public void {@link TabletListener#cursorDragged(TabletEvent) cursorDragged}({@link TabletEvent} event) {
 *          // Print out tablet drag events as they occur to system output
 *          System.out.println("dragged " + event);
 *      }
 *  });
 * </pre>
