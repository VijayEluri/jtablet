/**
 * <p>{@code TabletManager} is responsible for consuming events from any
 * attached tablet, filtering them as needed, and then forwarding the
 * remaining events to interested {@link cello.jtablet.event.TabletListener}s.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code TabletManager} relies on {@link cello.jtablet.driver.TabletDriver}s
 * to obtain events from native libraries. Rather than creating instances
 * of the necessary drivers yourself, JTablet handles everything in the background.
 * All that is required to start listening for {@link cello.jtablet.event.TabletEvent}s
 * is to register a {@link java.awt.Component} to receive them.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *  // Add tablet listener to component
 *  {@link TabletManager}.{@link TabletManager#addTabletListener(Component, TabletListener) addTabletListener}(component, new {@link TabletAdapter}() {
 *      public void {@link TabletListener#cursorDragged(TabletEvent) cursorDragged}({@link TabletEvent} event) {
