- don't rename anything public/protected with proguard (only remove classes)
- repackage jpen as something outside of cello.jtablet
- get extensionloader working
  - detect jtablet 0.9.x installation
- package installed jtablet.jar vs. applet/application jtablet2.jar that is included with apps so they can run without jtablet installed
- branch extensionloader to behave differently on included jar vs plugin jar

  - detect Java < 1.5 ?
  - deployJava.js ? 
- build native DLLs
